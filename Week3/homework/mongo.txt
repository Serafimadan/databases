All the steps of conversion:
--------------------------------
Firstly, I save nessecary tables in csv format. I used commands from reading material with little changis 
(select * into outfile '/Users/Shared/city.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from city;).
To do it right I was forced to put in my file my.cnf with one new row 'secure_file_priv="/Users/Shared"'
for avoid following mistake "ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so 
it cannot execute this statement".

Then, on the https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas made registration and
created a new cluster (was choosed Azure , Europe , Netherlands).

I have followed all steps wich offered by sistem (Build your first cluster;-> Create your first database user; ->
Whitelist your IP address; -> Load Sample Data (Optional).

I selected a connection method - MongoDB compass.
Downloaded MongoDB Compass to my computer.
Pasted a link from Atlas into MongoDB 
compass pow in my local machine, replaced "<password>" with my password of the database.

Then, I created a database (World) and a collections name (city, country, countrylanguage) in MongoDB compass. 
In every collections was imported the nessecary data from csv files. 
After, in Atlas I saw my database and collections.
